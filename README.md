Hi!
This (extremely) simple python script is able to tweet automatically some tweets from the first column in a .xls file. 
To work, it needs Twitter's API keys (you can find how to get them on dev.twitter.com). 
When you run this script, it will ask you to type a number and press enter: this is be the number of seconds it'll sleep between each tweet. 
The tweet.xls file is just an example; you can add #hashtags and @mentions inside it with no problems.
